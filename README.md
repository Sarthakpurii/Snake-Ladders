# Snake-Ladders
This is a Snake & Ladders Game with default rules.

This is a project I created on my own in 2019 when I was in 11th standard with python and its GUI library called turtle and some other libraries that supported the project. I was keenly interested in coding and it motivated me to create a real world project.
